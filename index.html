                    DPS-MIS DEBATERS WON AGAINST TEAM UAE
                </h5>
                <p>On 28th may 2020, Thursday, DPSMIS held a friendly online debate through the platform of zoom against Team UAE. It was an impromptu round which meant that the debaters got to know about the motion only half an hour before the debate. The motion on the floor was “This House Believes That Developing Countries Experiencing Critical Brain Should Impose Significant Restriction On Emigration.”<br>
                    On team proposition there were Akshal Jain, Aadit Palica and Rohan Goda of Team UAE. On team opposition Arya Kanade, Nakshatra Gayan and Farhan Sakkir from Team DPS-MIS.<br>
                    This fierce debate was judged by a panel from across the world Arthur Louis Heath from UK followed by Dominic Fwamba from Tanzania, Njuguna Macharia from Kenya, Jisha Oomen from UAE, Sandra Ramachandran from India, Aryan Adhlakha from USA and our very own Jaefar Shameem from DPSMIS, Qatar.<br>
                    This great battle of words ended by a spilt decision favoring team DPS-MIS. The panel voted Nakshatra Gayan as the best speaker of the debate.<br>
                    This unconventional yet modern platform of debate gave not only the debaters but also the observers a chance to enhance their knowledge of current scenarios around the world taking them a step closer to becoming future global citizens and world leaders.</p>
